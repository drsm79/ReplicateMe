ReplicateMe
===================

ReplicateMe is a simple app that runs in your **local** CouchDB instance. Sites
running CouchDB can add a ReplicateMe button to their pages. This takes you to
this application on your local instance where you can configure (continuous vs
one shot, one way vs bidirectional) and trigger replication.

I think @jchris had the idea...

TODO

 1. Deal with non-standard couch ports/remote couch instances
